# How to contribute

If you want to contribute to Ananas, first of all: thank you for your interest!

We use a fairly straightforward development flow:
- To work on a new feature, fork the repository and create a new feature branch.
	- If your feature is purely layout/design-related, prefix the branch name with `layout`.
	For example: `layout-settings-view`.
- When you feel your feature is stable enough, create a pull request against `master`.
